# Tapper Plan
# Overview of the Game Concept

Based on the provided screenshot, 

![tapper-example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrikkjonsson/tapper/main/tapper-example.jpg)

which depicts a pixelated scene from the classic arcade game Tapper (featuring Budweiser branding, multiple bar counters, advancing customers, a sliding mug, and the bartender), the goal is to build a modern recreation. This will be a fast-paced action game where the player acts as a bartender serving drinks to impatient customers across multiple bars to prevent chaos. The core mechanics will mirror the original: pouring and sliding drinks, catching empties, collecting tips, and progressing through themed levels with increasing difficulty. To keep it faithful, we'll incorporate Budweiser-themed elements from the screenshot (e.g., the logo and saloon-style bars), but make it optional for branding concerns.

The development will use Python with the Pygame library, as it's suitable for 2D arcade-style games, handles sprites and input well, and is accessible for prototyping. The game will be structured as a single-player arcade experience with scoring, lives, and level progression. Estimated development time: 2-4 weeks for a basic version, assuming one developer with intermediate Python skills.

# Step-by-Step Development Plan

1. **Research and Requirements Gathering (1-2 days)**

   * Analyze the screenshot in detail: It shows a saloon setting with 4 staggered bars, a bartender at the bottom-right near a tap, customers (e.g., one with a green hat on the middle bar, another cowboy-like figure), a sliding mug, beer taps on the right, a Budweiser sign at the top, score (550), and lives/indicator (0). This confirms the core layout: vertical bar stacking, left-to-right customer advance, and right-side taps.

   * Review original Tapper mechanics for accuracy:

     * Players control the bartender to serve non-stop waves of customers across 4 bars.

     * Customers enter from the left (doors) and advance right toward the taps; serve them by sliding full mugs leftward, which they catch and slide back empties.

     * Failure conditions: Empty mug falls off right end (breaks), full mug reaches left end unpicked, or customer reaches right end (throws bartender out).

     * Tips appear randomly; collecting them triggers a distraction (dancers) that pauses customers briefly.

     * Levels cycle through themes (saloon with cowboys, sports bar with athletes, punk bar with rockers, space bar with aliens), with bonus "can-shaking" rounds between levels.

   * Define scope: Start with the saloon level from the screenshot, add 3 more levels later. Include high scores, 3 lives, and endless looping with speed increases.

   * Tools needed: Python 3.x, Pygame (for graphics, input, and sound). Use free assets (e.g., from OpenGameArt.org) or pixel art tools like Aseprite for custom sprites mimicking the screenshot's 8-bit style.

2. **Project Setup and Basic Framework (2-3 days)**

   * Create a new Python project directory with files: main.py (game loop), entities.py (classes for game objects), constants.py (settings like screen size, colors), and assets/ folder for images/sounds.

   * Initialize Pygame: Set up a window (e.g., 640x480 resolution to match arcade feel), clock for 60 FPS, and event loop.

   * Implement basic input handling:

     * Keyboard controls (to emulate arcade joystick/tap): Arrow keys for up/down (switch bars), left/right (move along bar), spacebar for pouring/sliding drinks.

     * Optional: Add gamepad support later for authenticity.

   * Load initial assets: Background (blue gradient with Budweiser logo and chalkboard from screenshot), bar sprites (brown counters), tap icons.

3. **Implement Core Game Entities and Mechanics (5-7 days)**

   * Define classes using Pygame sprites:

     * Bartender: Positioned at the right end by default. Methods for moving between bars (up/down), running along bar (left/right), and pouring (animate filling mug at tap, then slide it left).

     * Customer: Subclasses for types (e.g., Cowboy from screenshot). Spawn at left end, move right at increasing speeds. Animate walking, catching drinks (slide back left upon catch), leaving tips randomly.

     * Mug: Full and empty variants. Physics for sliding left (full) or right (empty). Collision detection for catching by customers or bartender.

     * Tip: Coin sprite that slides left; collect for points and trigger distraction (spawn dancers that pause customers for 3-5 seconds).

     * Background Elements: Static bars, taps, doors. Match screenshot's perspective (staggered bars for 3D illusion).

   * Core loop logic:

     * Spawn customers randomly on bars, increasing frequency per level.

     * Update positions: Customers advance; mugs slide; check collisions (e.g., customer grabs full mug, bartender catches empty).

     * Scoring: +points for served customers, bonuses for tips and completions.

     * Lives: Deduct on failures; game over at 0 lives.

   * Add sound effects: Pouring, sliding, breaking glass, customer grunts (use free SFX libraries like freesound.org).

4. **Level Progression and Bonus Features (3-5 days)**

   * Structure levels based on themes:

     * Level 1: Saloon (cowboys, 2 screens/waves), matching screenshot.

     * Level 2: Sports (athletes, 3 screens).

     * Level 3: Punk (rockers, 4 screens).

     * Level 4: Space (aliens, 4 screens).

     * After Level 4, loop with faster speeds and more customers per bar (up to 4 max).

   * Bonus round: After each level, shuffle 6 cans; player selects one. Animate shaking; reward points for unshaken can (flash hint briefly).

   * Distraction mechanic: On tip collection, spawn dancers; pause non-drinking customers.

   * Difficulty scaling: Faster customer speed, shorter push-back on drink catch, more simultaneous customers.

5. **UI, Polish, and Testing (3-5 days)**

   * Add HUD: Score (top-left like screenshot's 550), lives (top-right, starting at 3), level indicator.

   * Menus: Start screen with instructions, high score table, pause/exit.

   * Animations: Bartender celebrations (e.g., drinking animation on level clear), customer throws on failure.

   * Testing:

     * Unit tests for mechanics (e.g., mug sliding physics using Pygame's rect collisions).

     * Playtesting for balance: Ensure early levels are approachable, later ones challenging.

     * Bug fixes: Edge cases like multiple mugs on one bar, wrapping bar switches.

   * Optimization: Cap FPS, handle variable screen sizes.

6. **Deployment and Enhancements (1-2 days)**

   * Package as executable (using PyInstaller) for Windows/Mac/Linux.

   * Optional enhancements: Multiplayer mode (split-screen), mobile port (using Pygame subset for Android), or online high scores.

   * Legal notes: Avoid direct Budweiser trademarks in final distribution; use generic beer or root beer theme if needed (inspired by Root Beer Tapper variant).

This plan provides a complete roadmap for a faithful recreation. Start with a minimum viable product (single level) and iterate based on testing. If needed, prototype mechanics in a code sandbox to validate ideas before full implementation.
